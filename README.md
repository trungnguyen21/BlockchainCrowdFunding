## Attention
- This project is on an Ethereum testnet (Goerli).
- Goerli (the testnet) is deprecated as of Jan 2024, I am working on a migration to Sepolia

## Features:
- Create and deploy your campaign on our website! Include a story, deadline and a target goal for a better result.
- Donate to your favourite campaign(s)! Enjoy gasless transactions and 100% of what you donated will go directly to the receiver.

## Specs:
- Front-end: Vite, React, Tailwind CSS
- Smart Contract: Solidity, deployed on ThirdWeb
- Automation: OpenZepplin, auto-pay your transaction fees

## How to setup:
1. Supplement your credentials: your Metamask Wallet secret key is required.
2. Configuring the Smart Contract. Deploy on ThirdWeb using `npm run deploy` (must be in `crowdfunding` dir)
3. Deploy the front-end: `npm run dev` (must be in `client` dir)
